# Escape
Once upon a time there was an employee who was waiting on her tasks to be approved and projects to start --- so she thought to make a game about Escaping from the office. 

The full game never came to completion,  but i am proud of alot of things I did in this game.

- The floorplan is the full floor plan of the office of my first job
- The baddie (red guy) is actually using A* search based on decision points in the map. the decision points are where hallways meet. When a player moves over a spot, that spot will be the next goal destination of the baddie.  It's not perfect but it's fun
- I love how past Ren set up the walls to look like your looking down at a doll house. 

### Game Objective
